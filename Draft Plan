Gather feedback on the wireframes and features from potential users.
Refine the design based on the feedback collected.

Step 1: Create Detailed Wireframes
Research Existing Habit Tracker Apps: Gather ideas and best practices from popular habit tracker apps.
Sketch Initial Wireframes: Visualize the core features: daily habit tracking, streaks, rewards, and AI-powered habit suggestions.
Use a Wireframing Tool: Create detailed wireframes based on the sketches for a clear and professional presentation.

Step 2: Gather User Feedback
Prepare a Survey: Develop a questionnaire to gather feedback on the wireframes.
Share Wireframes and Survey: Share with a group of target users (friends, family, or an online community interested in habit tracking).
Analyze Feedback: Identify common themes or suggestions for improvements.

Next Steps
Iterate on the wireframes based on user feedback.
Plan the development phases based on the final wireframes and gathered feedback.
